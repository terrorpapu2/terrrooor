			subtitle: "The road to civilization was long and treacherous, but you finally reached a village. It was a quiet, eerie place—too quiet. The villagers stared at you with empty expressions, their trades conducted in silence. Something was off. One of them handed you an item without asking for anything in return, their hand trembling slightly. Before you could question it, they hurried away, glancing nervously at the surrounding darkness."

			subtitle: "A strange path led you into the forest, where you stumbled upon an abandoned campsite. The fire was still smoldering, yet no one was there. Torn tents, claw marks on the trees—something had been here, and it hadn’t left peacefully.Further ahead, you found it. A house, old and decayed, standing alone among the trees. The windows were broken, the door slightly ajar. A single candle flickered inside, casting moving shadows that didn’t match the stillness of the room. As you stepped closer, the air grew heavier, the cold biting into your skin. You weren’t sure if you should enter, but something was drawing you in—something that had been waiting."
